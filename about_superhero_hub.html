        It all began with a group of friends who shared a passion for superhero movies and comics. Frustrated by the scattered information and lack of a dedicated space for fans, they decided to create a hub where enthusiasts could come together, explore their favorite heroes, and discover new ones. What started as late-night discussions and movie marathons soon turned into a mission to build Superhero HUBâ€”a platform by fans, for fans, celebrating the universes and stories that inspire us all.
